# Design-of-two-stage-fully-compensated-OPAMP

This is one of my academic project from Spring 2018 semester. Course __EECT 6326: Analog Integrated Circuits Design__. In this course I got an introduction to the principles of analog IC design. I aquired the knowledge of circuit level analog IC design required in industry and research. With this knowledge, I designed an _Two stage Operational Amplifier with miller compensation and programmable nulling resistor_.
You can go through this text or you can just refer the project report I made which is attached in the same repository.
